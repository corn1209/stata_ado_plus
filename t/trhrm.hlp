{title:Description}

{pstd}
{cmd:trhrm} calculates hazard ratios from the threshold regression mixture model fitted by the {cmd:stthregm} command. 


{title:Options for trhrm}

{dlgtab:Hazard Ratio}

{phang}
{opth var(varname)} specifies the name of the categorical variable for the calculation of hazard ratios.

{phang}
{opth scenario(string)} this option must be used if any covariates other than the categorical variable specified in var() option are also included in the threshold regression mixture model fitted by the {cmd:stthregm} command. scenario() option is to assign values to those covariates by equations, one by one and seperated by a blank space. scenario() option is to set up a scenario at which hazard ratios are calculated.

{phang}
{opth timevalue(numlist)} this option must be specified. This timevalue() option is to assign time point values at which hazard ratios are calculated.

{dlgtab:Graph}
{phang}
{opt graph(hz|sv|ds|hr)} specifies the type of curves to be generated. The ``hz'' option is to plot hazard function curves, the ``sv'' option is to plot survival function curves, the ``ds'' option is to plot density function curves, and the ``hr'' option is to plot hazard ratio tendency plot over the specified time points.

{phang}
{opt graphopt(string)} specifies the graph settings (titles, legends, etc). If this option is used, the default graph settings in the {cmd:trhrm} command will be ignored and the styles (such as titles, legends, labels, etc) of the output graphs completely depend on the options provided in graphopt(string). Since the {cmd:line} command in STATA is used in the {cmd:trhrm} command to plot curves, any options suitable for the {cmd:trhrm} command can be used in the graphopt(string) option to produce desired graphic styles.

{phang}
{opt y1} is used to add a horizontal line at $y=1$ to the hazard ratio tendency plot, in order to compare the hazard ratio values with the value of 1 graphically.

{dlgtab: Confidence interval}
{phang}
{opt ci} is used to output the bootstrap percentile confidence interval of the estimated hazard ratio value. By default, 2,000 boostrap replications will be performed and the confidence level is 95%.

{phang}
{opt bootstrap(#)} specifies the number of boostrap replications. By default, 2,000 bootstrap replications will be performed.

{phang}
{opt level(#)} is used to set the confidence level of the bootstrap percentile confidence interval of the hazard ratio value; default is {cmd:level(95)}.


{dlgtab: Saving results}

{phang}
{opt keep} is used to save the estimated hazard ratio values of specified time points in the current dataset. The specified time values are saved under a new variable with name ``hr_t''; the hazard ratio values are saved under a new variable with name headed with ``hr'' and tailed with the name of the corresponding dummy variable. If the ``ci'' option is used, then the lower and upper limit values of the confidence intervals will also be saved under two new variables with names headed with ``hrll'' and ``hrul'' respectively and tailed with the name of the corresponding dummy variable.

{phang}
{opt prefix(string)} specifies a string that will be attached to the head of the names of the new variables generated by the ``keep'' option.
