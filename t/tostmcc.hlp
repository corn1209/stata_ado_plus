{pstd}
{cmd:mcc} tests stochastic dominance of exposure in matched case-control data.  
It calculates a Wald-type asymptotic z test ({help tostmcc##Liu2002:Liu, et al., 2002}) 
in a two one-sided tests approach ({help tostmcc##Schuirmann1987:Schuirmann, 1987}).
{cmd:tostmcci} is the immediate form of {cmd:tostmcc}; see {help immed}.  Typically the 
null hypotheses of the corresponding McNemar's chi-square test 
({help tostmcc##McNemar1947:McNemar, 1947}) for stochastic dominance are 
framed from an assumption of stochastic equality (or distributional sameness) 
between cases and controls (e.g. Ho: P(exposure|case) = P(exposure|controls), 
rejecting this assumption only with sufficient evidence.  When performing tests 
of stochastic equivalence, the null hypothesis is framed as one population 
stochastically dominates the other by at least as much as the equivalence 
interval defined by some chosen level of tolerance (as specified by {opt eqvt:ype} 
and {opt eqvl:evel}).{p_end}

{pstd}
With respect to a z test, a negativist null hypothesis takes one of the 
following two forms depending on whether tolerance is defined in terms of
Delta (equivalence expressed in the units of the probability of counts of 
discordant pairs) or in terms of epsilon (equivalence expressed in the units of 
the z distribution):
 
{p 8}
Ho: |b - c| >= Delta, {p_end}
{p 8 8}where the equivalence interval ranges from |b - c|-Delta to 
|b - c|+Delta, and where b is the count of pairs with cases exposed, but 
controls unexposed, and and c is the count of pairs with cases unexposed and 
controls exposed. This null hypothesis translates directly into two one-sided 
null hypotheses: {p_end}

{p 12}
Ho1: Delta - (b - c) <= 0; and{p_end}

{p 12}
Ho2: (b - c) + Delta <= 0{p_end}

{p 8}
-OR-

{p 8}
Ho: |z| >= epsilon, {p_end}
{p 8 8}where the equivalence interval ranges from -epsilon to epsilon.  This also 
translates directly into two one-sided null hypotheses: {p_end}

{p 12}
Ho1: epsilon - z <= 0; and{p_end}

{p 12}
Ho2: z + epsilon <= 0{p_end}

{p 8 8}
When an asymmetric equivalence interval is defined using the {opt upper:eqvlevel} option 
the general negativist null hypothesis becomes:{p_end}

{p 8}
Ho: (b - c) <= Delta_lower, or (b - c) >= Delta_upper,{p_end}
{p 8 8 }
where the equivalence interval ranges from (b - c) + Delta_lower to 
(b - c) + Delta_upper.  This also translates directly into two one-sided null 
hypotheses:{p_end}

{p 12}
Ho1: Delta_upper - (b - c) <= 0; and{p_end}

{p 12}
Ho2: (b - c) - Delta_lower <= 0{p_end}

{p 8}
-OR-

{p 8}
Ho: z <= epsilon_lower, or z >= epsilon_upper,{p_end}

{p 12}
Ho1: epsilon_upper - z <= 0; and{p_end}

{p 12}
Ho2: z - epsilon_lower <= 0{p_end}
 
{pstd}
NOTE: the appropriate level of alpha is precisely the same as in the 
corresponding McNemar's test for stochastic dominance, so that, for example, if 
one wishes to make a Type I error %5 of the time, one simply conducts both of 
the one-sided tests of Ho1 and Ho2 by comparing the resulting p-value to 0.05 
({help tostmcc##Tryon2008:Tryon and Lewis, 2008}).{p_end}

{dlgtab:Main}

{phang}
{opth eqvt:ype(string)} defines whether the equivalence interval will be 
defined in terms of Delta or epsilon ({opt delta}, or {opt epsilon}).  These 
options change the way that {opt evql:evel} is interpreted: when {opt delta} is 
specified, the {opt evql:evel} is measured in the units of the variable being 
tested, and when {opt epsilon} is specified, the {opt evql:evel} is measured in 
multiples of the standard deviation of the z distribution; put another way 
epsilon = Delta/standard error.  The default is {opt delta}.{p_end}

{marker mineqvlevel}{...}
{p 8 8}
Defining tolerance in terms of epsilon means that it is not possible to reject 
any test of mean equivalence Ho if epsilon <= the critical value of z for a 
given alpha.  Because epsilon = n*Delta/standard error, we can see that it is not 
possible to reject any Ho if Delta <= the product of the standard error and 
critical value of z over n for a given alpha.  {cmd: tostmcc} reports when either 
of these conditions obtain.  Tolerances should be specified using {opt delta} by 
considering the difference in P(b) and P(c).{p_end}

{phang}
{opth eqvl:evel(#)} defines the equivalence threshold for the tests depending on 
whether {opt eqvt:ype} is {opt delta} or {opt epsilon} (see above).  Researchers 
are responsible for choosing meaningful values of Delta or epsilon.  The default 
value is .1 when {opt delta} is the {opt eqvt:ype} and 2 when {opt epsilon} is 
the {opt eqvt:ype}.{p_end}

{phang}
{opt upper:eqvlevel(#)} defines the {it: upper} equivalence threshold for the test, 
and transforms the meaning of {opt eqvl:evel} to mean the {it: lower} equivalence 
threshold for the test.  Also, {opt eqvl:evel} is assumed to be a negative value.  
Taken together, these correspond to Schuirmann's ({help tostranksum##Schuirmann1987:1987}) 
asymmetric equivalence intervals.  If {opt upper:eqvlevel}==|{opt eqvl:evel}|, then 
{opt upper:eqvlevel} will be ignored.{p_end}

{phang}
{opt yates} specifies that the test statistics incorporate a Yates continuity 
correction ({help tostmcc##Yates1934:Yates, 1934}) using the term [(b - c)-0.5] 
for z1, and the term [(b - c)+0.5] for z2. {opt yates} is exclusive of {opt edwards}{p_end}

{phang}
{opt edwards} specifies that the test statistics incorporate an Edwards continuity 
correction ({help tostmcc##Edwards1947:Edwards, 1947}) using the term [(b - c)-1] 
for z1, and the term [(b - c)+1] for z2. {opt edwards} is exclusive of {opt yates}{p_end}

{phang}
{opt level(#)} specifies the confidence level, as a percentage, for 
determination of the thresholds at which rejecting Ho in favor of stochastic 
equivalence is impossible.  The default is {opt level(95)} or as set by {helpb set level}.
