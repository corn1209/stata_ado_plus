{title:Description}

{p 4 4 2}{cmd:mvppred} provides predictions following estimation of an
{it:M}-equation probit model by the method of simulated maximum 
likelihood (SML) using the program {cmd:mvprobit}. See {help mvprobit}.
Predictions provided for each equation are the fitted index values,
the standard errors of the fitted index values for each equation, the 
predicted marginal success probabilities, and two predicted joint 
probabilities. These are (i) Pr(depvar_{it:i} = 1, all {it:i}) and 
(ii) Pr(depvar_{it:i} = 0, all {it:i}), for equations {it:i} = 
1,...,{it:M}. (Additional joint probabilities and conditional 
probabilities have not been provided because the number of such 
probabilities increases substantially as {it:M} increases.) The 
multivariate normal distributions used to calculate the joint 
probabilities are derived by simulation using the GHK simulator, 
with the seed and number of random draws the same as used by {cmd:mvprobit} 
to derive the parameter estimates.


{title:Options}

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:xb}, the default, calculates the linear prediction (Xb) for 
each equation. Results are stored in the variables {it:newvarname_prefixi}, 
for equations {it:i} = 1,...,{it:M}.

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:stdp} calculates the standard error of the linear prediction 
(Xb) for each equation. Results are stored in the variables 
{it:newvarname_prefixi}, for equations {it:i} = 1,...,{it:M}.

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:pmarg} calculates the marginal probit predicted probability 
of success for each outcome, Pr(depvar{it:i}) = 1, for each equation 
{it:i} = 1,...,{it:M}. Results are stored in the variables 
{it:newvarname_prefixi}, for equations {it:i} = 1,...,{it:M}.

{p 4 8 2}{cmd:pall} calculates (i) the probit predicted joint probability of 
success in every outcome, Pr(depvar{it:i}) = 1, for all {it:i} = 1,...,{it:M}, 
and (ii) the probit joint probability of failure in every outcome, 
Pr(depvar{it:i}) = 0, for all {it:i} = 1,...,{it:M}. Results are stored in 
the variables {it:newvarname_prefix1s} for predicted probability (i) and 
{it:newvarname_prefix0s} for predicted probability (ii).
