{title:Description}

{pstd}
Calculates eigenvector centrality for each node {it:i} in a network or network list and 
saves the result as Stata variables. It assigns relative scores to all nodes in the network 
based on the concept that connections to high-scoring nodes contribute more to the score of 
the node in question than equal connections to low-scoring nodes.

{pstd}
Eigenvector centrality is only defined for connected networks.

{pstd}
The Stata variable {it:varname} is overwritten. In case, eigenvector centrality is calculated
for {it:z} networks at the same time (e.g. {bf:nwvcent glasgow1 glasgow2}), the command generates the variables
{it:varname_z} for each network.
