{pstd}
Keeps nodes of a network. The nodes that are to be kept can be either specifified by their {help nodeid} or by their {help nodeid:nodelab}
in option {bf:nodes()}. Alternatively, one can also keep nodes based on a mata matrix. 

{pstd}
By default, the command overwrites the original network. This cannot be undone. Hence, it is recommended to specify option {bf:generate()},
which generates a new network instead and keeps the original network as it was. 

{pstd}
The command mirrors {help nwdropnodes}.


{pstd}
Keep the first seven nodes of network {it:flomarriage} and save it as network {it:flomarriage_reduced}:

{pmore}
{cmd:. webnwuse florentine, nwclear}{p_end}
{pmore}
{cmd:. nwkeep flomarriage, nodes(1/7) generate(flomarriage_reduced)}{p_end}


{pstd}
Keep the nodes "medici" and "pucci":

{pmore}
{cmd:. webnwuse florentine, nwclear}{p_end}
{pmore}
{cmd:. nwkeepnodes flomarriage, nodes(medici pucci)}{p_end}


{pstd}
Alternatively, one can also keep nodes based on a mata matrix. This drops the first node:

{pmore}
{cmd:. webnwuse florentine, nwclear}{p_end}
{pmore}
{cmd:. mata: k = (0\1\1\1\1\1\1\1\1\1\1\1\1\1\1\1)}{p_end}
{pmore}
{cmd:. nwkeepnodes flomarriage, keepmat(k)}{p_end}

{pstd}
Everything this command does can also be achieved with {help nwkeep} using the {bf:if} condition. For example, the following
command also keeps the first seven nodes:

{pmore}
{cmd:. webnwuse florentine, nwclear}{p_end}
{pmore}
{cmd:. nwkeep flomarriage if _n <= 7}{p_end}
