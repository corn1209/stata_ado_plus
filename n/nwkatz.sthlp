{title:Description}

{pstd}
Calculates the Katz (1953) centrality for each node {it:i} in a network or network list and 
saves the result as Stata variables. Katz centrality is an extension of degree centrality (see {help nwdegree}).
Degree centrality measures the number of direct neighbors, and Katz centrality measures the number of all 
nodes that can be connected through a path, while the contributions of distant nodes are penalized. 

{pstd}
It assigns weights to each pair of nodes {it:(i,j)} based on their distance {it:dist_ij(g)} (see {help nwgeodesic}) 
and a penalization factor {bf:alpha()}.

{pstd}
Formally, Katz centrality is defined as:

{pmore}
{it:Katz_i(g) = sum( alpha ^ dist_ij(g) ), over all j connected to i}

{pstd}
The Stata variable {it:varname} is overwritten. In case, eigenvector centrality is calculated
for {it:z} networks at the same time (e.g. {bf:nwkatz glasgow1 glasgow2}), the command generates the variables
{it:varname_z} for each network.
