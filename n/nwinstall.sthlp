{title:Description}

{pstd}
This command loads Stata dialog boxes for the nwcommands and installs a menu "Network Analysis" inside the "User" menu. Almost
all nwcommands (and their functions) can be executed via dialog boxes. Notice, however, that some more 
advanced functions are only available through Stata syntax (see {help nwcommands}).


{title:Example}

{pstd}
I recommend you run this first after you installed the package "nwcommands-ado". It installs all help files and dialog boxes.

	{cmd:. nwinstall, all}
	

{pstd}
This installs a menu for the nwcommands:

	{cmd:. nwinstall, permanently}
