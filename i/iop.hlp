{dlgtab 0 0:Description}{marker description}

{p 0 0 2} This routine computes different measures of ex-ante inequality of opportunity for continuous, binary and ordered 
variables proposed in the literature. The general idea behind these methods is to explain an outcome by people's circumstances
for which they cannot be held responsible. The general approach has two (sometimes three) steps: {break}

{p 2 5} 1. First the expected outcome, conditional on circumstances, is computed. All variation is exclusively due to circumstances. This is done
by the means of an OLS or a probit, depending on the type of variable. {break}

{p 2 5} 2. An inequality measure is applied to this conditional expectation. {break}

{p 2 7}(3.) Sometimes a third step is performed where the inequality measure is divided by the same inequality measure computed on the 
original outcome in order to get a relative measure of inequality. 

{p 0 0}For more details, see for instance Wendelspiess Chávez Juárez (2013).

{p 0 4 0} {marker fg1} {hi:{help iop##ref_fg1:Ferreira & Gignoux  - Continuous variables with inherent scale}} (abbreviation: fg1)
Ferreira & Gignoux (2011) propose to estimate first an OLS regression of the continuous outcome (positive values) on a set of circumstances. 
The log mean deviation (MLD) is then applied to the predicted values (conditional expectation}. By dividing this measure by the mean log 
deviation of the original outcome variable, a relative measure of inequality of opportunity is obtained. These measures are scale, but not 
translation invariant. 

{p 0 4 5}{marker fg2}{hi:{help iop##ref_fg2:Ferreira & Gignoux  - Continuous variables without inherent scale}} (abbreviation: fg2)
Ferreira & Gignoux (2011b) is very similar to Ferreira & Gignoux (2011) but is particularly suited for continuous variables without 
inherent scale (e.g. test scores). For such variables, a measure that is both, translation and scale invariant is needed. They propose to use the 
relative measure only and as inequality indicator the variance. The resulting relative inequality of opportunity measure is equal to the 
R squared of a simple OLS regression. This measure is translation and scale invariant. 

{p 0 4 5}{marker pdb}{hi:{help iop##ref_pdb:Paes de Barros (2008) - Dichotomous and ordered variables}} (abbreviation: pdb)
Paes de Barros et al (2008) propose to estimate first a probit on the dummy variable (for ordered variable a threshold must be chosen and dummy 
constructed). The predicted probability (conditional probability) is then used to compute the dissimilarity index, which is an absolute measure 
of inequality in opportunity. The measure is scale but not translation invariant. 

{p 0 4 5}{marker ws}{hi:{help iop##ref_ws:Wendelspiess Chávez Juárez (2013) - Dichotomous and ordered variables}} (abbreviation: ws)
This method is basically the same as Paes de Barros et al (2008) but uses a modified dissimilarity index that is translation 
invariant but not scale invariant.

{p 0 3 3}*= fg1 is used for the method in general, while we use {hi:fg1a} and {hi:fg1r} to distinguish between the absolute and the relative measure respectively. 

Alternative Stata routines are mentioned {help iop##alternatives:below}. 



{dlgtab 0 0:Options}{marker options}

{p 4 8 2}{marker type}{cmdab:t:ype(}{it:str}{hi:)} can be used to specify the type of the variable. It is optional because {hi:iop} tries to figure out on
its own the type of the dependent variable. If {hi:iop} fail at identifying the type, you can specify it here. The possible values are: 
{break}
{hi:c}   continuous variables{break}
{hi:o}   ordered variables{break}
{hi:d}   dummy variables

{p 4 8 2}{cmdab:d:etail} allows you to display the OLS regression or the probit model estimated by {hi:iop}. By default, these models are not displayed.

{marker optshapley}
{p 4 8 2}{cmdab:s:hapley(}{it:str}{hi:)} allows you to decompose the inequality of opportunity measure in the relative contribution of each
circumstance variable based on the Shapley value. Note that due to possibly omitted circumstances, these values cannot be seen as causal (see 
{help iop##ref_fg1:Ferreira & Gignoux (2011)}) for a discussion on this issue). 

{marker optgroup}
{p 4 8 2}{cmdab:o:axaca(}{it:groupvar stat}{hi:)} Using this option, {cmd:iop} performs a Oaxaca-like decomposition according to the group variable. This group 
variable should be numeric and contain a finite number of different values. No upper limit is given, but for a proper display, you should not exceed 10 values.
This option is only available for dichotomous and continuous variables. If you would like to use if for an ordered variable, first dichotomize it and then use the 
syntax for dummy variables. The option uses two arguments, the first {it:groupvar} is the variable indicating the groups and {it:stat} is the statistic you 
want to decompose. For dummy variables the possible values are {it:pdb} and {it:ws}, while for continuous variables only {it:fg1a} is available, since the
relative measures should not be decomposed in this way.  


{ul:Options of the {help iop##oldsyntax:old syntax} (Version 1.0)}

{p 4 8 2}{cmdab:boot:strap}{cmd:(}{it:int}{cmd:)} Use this option to include bootstrap confidence intervals of the dissimilarity index by indicating the desired 
amount of repetitions. The default value is 0, resulting in no computation of bootstrap confidence intervals. 

{p 4 8 2}{cmdab:decomp:osition} This option includes a decomposition of the computed dissimilarity index. The same method is used and all but one variable is set 
to the average when computing the predicted values. Beware of the fact that the sum of these estimates does not necessarily yield to the total effect. 

{p 4 8 2}{cmdab:gr:oups}{cmd:(}{it:varname (max=1)}{cmd:)} By activating this option, the decomposition across groups is performed. Indicate the categorical
 variable containing a definition of the groups.

{p 4 8 2}{cmdab:pr:opt}{cmd:(}{it:str}{cmd:)} Use this option to include special options in the probit estimation. Just write your probit options normally
 and they are transmitted to the probit estimation in the script.

{p 4 8 2}{cmdab:bootopt}{cmd:(}{it:str}{cmd:)} Use this option to include special options in the bootstrap sampling. Just write your bootstrap options
 normally and they are transmitted to the {it:bsample} command in the script.

 
 
{dlgtab 0 0:Estimating standard errors}{marker bootstrap}

{p}In version 1.0 we offered the possibility to estimate bootstrap standard errors. This option is no longer available, since we believe it is easier to 
estimate them using the Stata command {help bootstrap} directly. Using this command you have more flexibility in estimating the standard errors and specifying
the bootstrap according to your needs. Look at the {help iop##examples:last example} hereafter to find out how you can perform the bootstrap standard errors. 
Moreover, including analytical standard errors is planned for {help iop##developments:future developments}.
 
 
 
{dlgtab 0 0:Examples}{marker examples}

{p 0 8 2}{cmd:iop} access_school education_father family_income indigenous, shapley(pdb)

{p  4  4}This example calculates the inequality of opportunity in the access to schooling based on three explanatory variables: father's education,
 the family income and a dummy for indigenous people. Additionally, a shapley decomposition of the {help iop##pdb:Paes de Barros et al (2008)} method is performed.

{p 0 8 2}{cmd:iop} access_school education_father family_income indigenous, oaxaca(gender ws)

{p  4  4}This example performs the same estimation as the first example but adds the Oaxaca-like decomposition by gender, meaning that the 
adapted dissimilarity index is computed for women and men individually and for the counterfactual combinations as well. This is for example the dissimilarity 
index of women if they had the estimated coefficients of men or vice versa. 

{p 0 8 2}{cmd:iop} income education_father family_income indigenous, detail

{p  4  4} This method estimates inequality of opportunity in income based on the same three circumstances as in the first example. The option {it:detail}
allows seeing the underlying OLS estimation as well. Both methods proposed by Ferreira & Gignoux are applied. 

{p 0 8 2}{cmd:bootstrap} pdb=r(pdb) ws=r(ws),rep(200): {cmd:iop} income education_father family_income indigenous

{p  4  4} This example estimates exactly the same model as the example before, but computes in addition to the point estimates the 
bootstrap standard errors and confidence intervals for 200 replications. You should not perform the bootstrap together with the shapley-decomposition, 
or the oaxaca-like decomposition since this would be extremely computation intensive.  


{marker alternatives}
{dlgtab 0 0:Alternative routines}

{p 0 0 2} For the case of binary variables, an alternative routine to estimate the dissimilarity index is {stata ssc desc hoi:hoi}. Differences between the two routines include the estimation of the conditional probability (hoi uses
logit instead of probit) and mainly the options the routine offers to the user. For inference, {cmd:hoi} should be preferred, since it computes not only 
the bootstrap standard errors but also the analytical standard errors. 

If we forgot to mention another routine here, please let us know. 


{dlgtab 0 0:Future developments}{marker developments}

{p 0 0 2} The routine {cmd:iop} will be developed further. If you have particular suggestions, 
please let us know. {break} We tested the routine extensively before publication, however, we cannot exclude all errors. We appreciate a lot if you could indicate us eventual bugs in the 
program. {break}To update the routine type {stata ssc install iop, replace:scc install iop, replace}
